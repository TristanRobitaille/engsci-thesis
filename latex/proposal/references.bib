abstract = {Polysomnography refers to a systematic process used to collect physiologic parameters during sleep. A polysomnogram (PSG) is a procedure that utilizes electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry, as well as airflow and respiratory effort, to evaluate for underlying causes of sleep disturbances. PSG is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing sleep-related breathing disorders, which include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxia. PSG can also be utilized to evaluate for other sleep disorders, including nocturnal seizures, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. With recent technological developments, home sleep apnea testing can be done to confirm a diagnosis in patients with a high risk for moderate to severe OSA in the absence of comorbid medical conditions or other suspected sleep disorders.}
