I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Xilin Liu, for his guidance and support throughout the project. He has given me the freedom to explore new ideas and had provided me with the
support and tools I needed.

I would also like to thank my father, Claude Robitaille, for letting me remotely use his workstation to train the model and run the accuracy study. He has also helped review the code for the functional simulation.

In addition, I owe much to the professors who have taught me the fundamentals of computer architecture at the University of Toronto - Profs. Jason Anderson, Natalie Enright-Jerger, Andreas Moshovos and Mark C. Jeffrey.

Throughout this project, I have made extensive use the Compute Canada cluster, which has provided me with the computational resources I needed to train the model. I would like to thank the 
staff at Compute Canada for their initiative. I am also appreciative of the tools provided by the Canadian Microelectronics Corporation, which have been instrumental in the hardware implementation of the accelerator.

I would also like to acknowledge the work of Professors Lisa Romkey and Alan Chong who organized this thesis course, ensuring a structured and productive environment.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement throughout this project. I am grateful for their patience and understanding.
