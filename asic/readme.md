### Note
The synthesized design cannot be shared as it contains information protected under NDA. I am using TSMC 65nm. I can only share the RTL and high-level simulation outputs.

### Running CocoTB testbenches
CocoTB is used for testbenches for the RTL modules. Install the required modules with `pip install -r rtl/requirements.txt`.
